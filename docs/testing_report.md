# Testing Report

## Overview

This report documents the testing process for the Card RPG Laboratory project. The testing was conducted using the Google Test framework and covered various components of the system including character classes, card effects, game mechanics, and AI decision-making.

## Test Coverage

The project includes comprehensive test coverage for the following components:

1. **Base Classes**
   - Entity (health/mana management, status effects)
   - Character (leveling, experience, abilities)
   - Card (effects, mana costs)

2. **Character Classes**
   - Warrior (attack mechanics, abilities)
   - Mage (spell casting, mana usage)
   - Archer (ranged attacks, deck management)
   - Healer (healing abilities, support functions)

3. **Card System**
   - Attack cards (damage mechanics)
   - Defense cards (protective effects)
   - Spell cards (magical effects, status application)
   - Special cards (utility functions)

4. **Game Mechanics**
   - Effects (burn, poison, slow, regeneration)
   - Inventory management
   - Deck manipulation
   - Character progression

5. **AI Controllers**
   - EasyAI (basic decision-making)
   - AdvancedAI (strategic choices)
   - BossAI (specialized behavior patterns)

6. **Game Modes**
   - Battle Mode
   - PvP Mode
   - Dungeon Mode
   - Trading Mode
   - Exploration Mode

## Test Execution

Total tests: 49
Passed: 49
Failed: 0
Disabled: 0

## Code Quality Improvements

In addition to fixing specific test failures, several general improvements were made:

1. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive Doxygen documentation to all classes and methods
   - Improved comment clarity throughout the codebase
   - Updated class and method descriptions to match implementation

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added boundary checks for health and mana values
   - Improved null-pointer handling in deck and inventory operations
   - Added more informative error messages

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Reduced unnecessary object copies
   - Improved memory management through proper use of smart pointers
   - Optimized frequently called methods

## Conclusion

The testing process was successful in identifying and addressing several issues in the codebase. All tests are now passing, indicating that the system components are working as expected. The refactoring performed has improved code quality, functionality, and maintainability.
